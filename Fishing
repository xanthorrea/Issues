Description: Incorrect fish being looted in most areas.

Current behaviour: The fish Raw Brilliant Smallfish and Raw Longjaw Mud Snapper are fished in all the places I tried, except pools.  
This included high level zones, low level zones and mid level zones, open water, inland pools and lakes, puddles, rivers and seas.

Expected behaviour: Different level fish should be available in different zones.  
The current behaviour makes it IMPOSSIBLE to level cooking using fishing and you cannot loot raw Mithril Head Trout, Nightfin, etc.

Steps to reproduce the problem: Fish in any zone higher than a starting zone.
